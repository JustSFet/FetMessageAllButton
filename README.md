Create two new scripts, name 'Message All Button' and 'Fill Message All details' copy the two scripts from this repo into them and hit save

Now when you go to an even page, there will be a new field under the event name, you can fill in the desired subject and body, and hit Message all

# Notes
1. This does not actually send the message, instead it will open new tabs with all the attendies, you stil have to hit the send button
2. If you do not have permission to message someone, you still wont be able too message them
3. the first time you use it, it may only pop open one user, you may have to enable popups from fet (should be an indicator next to the url after first attempt)
